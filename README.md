# IBM Introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks with Keras

This repository contains four Jupyter Notebooks developed as part of the **IBM Introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks with Keras** course on Coursera. These notebooks explore various aspects of deep learning using the Keras library.

## Notebooks Overview

1. **Part A: Build a Baseline Model**  
   This notebook implements a simple neural network model with one hidden layer to predict concrete strength based on the provided dataset. The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

2. **Part B: Normalize the Data**  
   This notebook repeats the baseline model process using normalized data. It assesses how normalization impacts the performance of the model, reporting MSE results.

3. **Part C: Improved Model with Normalization**  
   An enhanced model with three hidden layers is built, trained on the normalized data. This section examines the model's performance compared to the baseline.

4. **Part D: Additional Enhancements**  
   Further enhancements and optimizations to the model are explored, focusing on improving accuracy and reducing error rates.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks, you need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
